    <p>
        Halloween, or All Hallows' Eve, is an annual holiday celebrated on October 31. Its origins can be traced back to
        the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. At that time, it was believed that the boundary between the living and
        the dead blurred, allowing spirits to walk the earth.
